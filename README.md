## About [_Grid Art Designer_](https://digitalwarenkombinat.github.io/grid/)

Grid Art Designer allows users to create and download grid-based SVG artwork, with options to toggle filters and download the final image as an SVG or PNG.

Inspired from Alex Trosts article [Creating Generative SVG Grids](https://frontend.horse/articles/generative-grids/).
